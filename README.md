Notes:
------

I have a installed quite a lot of Node Modules because I wanted to use Redux, Thunk etc. (still on a learning curve :-))

I also have an actions.js file which I would have loved to use for the ajax call but wanted to simplify things.

PS: Spending some time on getting the Days to iterate through for the 5 day forecast.
